Bobby is a simple command-line application which works as a task manager.   
With Bobby, you will be able to track and manage your tasks more efficiently.

Bobby supports three types of tasks:  
- ***Todo*** - tasks without a specific date or time  
- ***Deadline*** - tasks that need to be completed by a specific date/time  
- ***Event*** - tasks that have a start and end date/time
